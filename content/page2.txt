CAM is here to make the impossible possible, transforming how healthcare providers manage their revenue cycles and freeing them to focus on what truly matterspatient care.

Layering on top of existing RCM tools, CAM excels medical record review, compliance with regulations, knowledge of coding systems, communication with providers, and billing, all with the goal of accurate billing, maximized reimbursements, and relief from RCM strains.

Detailed Look at CAMs Capabilities
CAMs design incorporates a suite of advanced features aimed at streamlining and enhancing the claims processing and eligibility verification:

Automation of Claims Processing: CAM automates the entire workflow, from submission to approval, reducing manual intervention, speeding up processing times, and ensuring consistency.
Integration with Existing Systems: CAM works seamlessly with various electronic health record (EHR) systems, practice management software, and other healthcare IT solutions, ensuring smooth implementation.
Unlimited Claims Processing: CAM processes nearly unlimited claims and handle an unlimited amounts of data. Unlike human staff who tire and are prone to errors over time, CAM operates with unlimited bandwidth, maintaining high accuracy and efficiency continuously.
Complex Data Handling: CAM navigates if/then situations and numerous variables to find the correct outcomes, ensuring precise results.
User-Friendly Interface:  CAM offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface that simplifies the workflow for healthcare administrators.
Claims Reports: CAM provides run reports and approval reports, enhancing transparency into claims processes and successful claims pathways.
Customization Options: Providers work with Thoughtfuls Customer Engineers to tailor CAM to specific organizational needs and preferences for processing claims.
Enhanced Accuracy and Consistency: CAM ensures greater accuracy and consistency in claims handling. The AI agent's ability to handle large amounts of data and navigate complex decision-making scenarios enhances reliability and effectiveness.
AI-Driven Error Detection for Claims: CAM's AI algorithms perform sophisticated checks on claims data, identifying potential errors before submission, minimizing the risk of denials.
Accelerated Claims Processing Cycle: By automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows, CAM significantly reduces the time required to process claims, improving cash flow and operational efficiency.

How CAM Enhances Claims Processing and Reduces Errors
CAM leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of claims processing:

Data Set Customization with RAG Technology: Providers can select their own data sets using RAG technology. Using the most successful claims as a baseline for handling future similar claims leads to unprecedented success.
Instantaneous Data Handling: CAM saves and sorts through large data sets almost instantaneously, reducing redundancy in processes. While a human claims operator would need to sort through endless paperwork to determine the best course of action, CAM performs this task instantly.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and LLMs: CAM uses OCR to review manual files and large language models (LLMs) to determine the best recourses, reviewing electronic health records (EHRs) to identify optimal outcomes.
Comparison with Traditional Methods of Claims Processing
Traditional claims processing methods often involve endless manual checks of insurance providers policies and data entry, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Relying on human intervention can lead to delays and inconsistencies, resulting in incorrect claim submissions, deadline misses, and denials. CAM automates the entire claims processing workflow, ensuring accurate, real-time assessments that mitigate the risk of human error. This automation reduces the administrative burden on healthcare staff, improves the accuracy and speed of claim submissions, and enhances the overall efficiency of the claims process, representing a significant improvement in operational efficiency and reliability.

Proven Outcomes
CAMs effectiveness is evidenced by its impressive performance metrics across various healthcare providers:

Improved Claims Approval Rates: Data shows a marked increase in the approval rates of claims processed through CAM, due to its rigorous validation processes.
Decrease in Denied Claims: CAMs Precise eligibility verification and error-checking capabilities lead to fewer claim denials, resulting in fewer resubmissions and appeals.
Decreased Pressure and Stress on RCM Employees: For example, Allegiance Mobile Health experienced a 50% reduction in their claims scrubbing team, which has significantly alleviated the workload and stress on their revenue cycle management employees (Thoughtful RCM).
Case Studies or Examples Showing Improved Accuracy and Efficiency
Several healthcare providers have reported significant improvements after implementing CAM:

Allegiance Mobile Health: Achieved a 50% reduction in claims scrubbing team size, a 40% increase in speed to collections, and a 27% faster reimbursement time (Thoughtful RCM).
Trumpet Behavioral Health: By adopting Thoughtful's AI agents, Trumpet Behavioral Health was able to cut the run time of their processes, including primary and secondary claims, by 70%. This significant improvement has streamlined their workflow and reduced the administrative burden on their team (Thoughtful RCM).
Signature Dental: Reduced claims submission time by 25 days, increased year-over-year collections by 99%-101.2%, and improved staff productivity by 140% (Thoughtful RCM).
These case studies highlight CAM's ability to dramatically improve efficiency and effectiveness in claims processing and eligibility verification, resulting in significant operational and financial benefits.

Testimonials from Early Adopters
Feedback from early adopters highlights CAMs transformative impact:

Cara Perry, Signature Dental: Before utilizing Thoughtful, I had to trust that people that I didn't train were submitting claims correctly to the insurance, attaching x-rays, and narratives. With Thoughtful, I can control the claims, making sure that theyre going out correctly. Were not having to worry about submitting claims incorrectly, and being denied zero payments. Claims go out every night, the team has a lighter workload, and I know that its being done correctly.
Cara Perry, Signature Dental: Weve gone up in collections, our turn-around days are quicker, and we only had two practices under 90% for the year. My staff has gone from being able to work five practices to being able to work ten or twelve. Everything Thoughtful has been able to do so far has brought us to the next level.
Director of Finance, Trumpet Behavioral Health: "We've been thrilled with the product delivered by Thoughtful AI! Prior to our collaboration with Thoughtful AI, we were always playing 'catch up' when it came to processing our backlog of items in our revenue cycle. Now we are able to process claims immediately and without any errors. Thoughtful AI is a great company to work with and creates exemplary products!"
These testimonials reflect the high levels of satisfaction and the tangible benefits experienced by healthcare providers who have adopted CAM, demonstrating its substantial impact on operational efficiency and overall performance.

Impact on Administrative Workload and Pressure Reduction on RCM Employees
CAM significantly reduces administrative workload and operational costs. By automating repetitive tasks, CAM frees up administrative staff to tackle more strategic activities. The reduction in errors and denied claims translates into major cost savings, with many organizations witnessing a rapid return on investment from CAM.
