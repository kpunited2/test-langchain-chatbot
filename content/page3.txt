EVA can catch eligibility changes prior to all patient visits to prevent claim denials downstream. Our Eligibility Verification automation can initiate communication with the patient and/or payor to resolve eligibility issues with little to no impact on the patient and on the revenue cycle. As eligibility rules change across payors, Eligibility Verification houses a dynamic rules engine thats seamless to update. It can even initiate communication with the payor or provider to resolve unexpected changes in eligibility status.

The Challenges of Traditional Eligibility Verification
Eligibility verification has always been a critical step in the healthcare revenue cycle. However, traditional methods are fraught with challenges:

Manual Processes: Staff spend countless hours on the phone or navigating insurance websites, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors.
Delays and Errors: Manual verification often leads to delays in patient care and billing, not to mention the risk of errors that can result in claim denials.
High Costs: The administrative burden of eligibility verification can be costly, diverting resources away from patient care and other essential operations.
